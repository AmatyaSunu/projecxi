 # ProjecXi

ProjecXi is a web application developed as part of my course project for the *Human Factor Software Cycle* course. This project serves as the **SA Board Link**, a platform designed for various **South Australian Government Organizations** to manage and organize meetings within their organization or with external organizations.

## Key Features
- Designed following **SA Government brand specifications**, including color, font, and logo.
- A **multi-user portal** supporting different roles:
  - **General User**
  - **Secretary**
  - **Technical Administrator**
- **User authentication** and **role-based access control** to restrict features based on user roles.
- Core functionalities:
  - **Email notifications** for important updates
  - **Calendar integration** for scheduling meetings
  - **File management** (uploading & downloading attachments)
  - **Notice publication** for announcements
  - **User, meeting, and board management** (CRUD operations)

## Project Development
We followed a structured **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** approach with proper planning, design, and development phases:

1. **UI/UX Design**
   - Created **mockups and wireframes** using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/JWeyAyMjPCWk85RNpVnKs0/DevOps?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=Ya3sdYaY5DfiyjxN-0) to visualize the user interface.
2. **Development Process**
   - Built the project with a clear **roadmap** and **role division** within the team.
   - Followed **agile methodology**, iterating through multiple sprints with continuous updates.
3. **Final Release**
   - Incorporated feedback and refinements from each sprint to deliver a polished final product.
