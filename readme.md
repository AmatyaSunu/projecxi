# ProjecXi

ProjecXi is the project developed as a part of my course project for Human Factor Software Cycle course. This project is specifically developed as the SA Board link, which is the platform for various South Australian Government Organization to organize various meetings within their organization or between other organization. Following are the key points of the projects:

The project was developed with the SA Governement brand specification on mind. The brand specification is reflected on color, font and the logo.
It is a multiple user portal web application with general user, secretary and technical administrator.
It has user restriction on the features and uses user authentication for verification of user.
The project includes features like email notification, calendar update, uploading and downloading attachment, notice publication other than the usual user login, CRUD operations on users, meetings and boards. 


# Project Development
As a team, we designed and developed the whole project following the whole software development lifecycle. It started with making mockups and wireframes using Figma. The project was built with proper roadmaps and role division. The project went through numerous update following each sprint to the final project release.
